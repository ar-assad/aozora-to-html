# AozoraToHTML
Convert Aozora Bunko files to HTML for use with popup dictionary extensions like YomiChan. Intended as a replacement for JNovelFormatter which is not open source and which is Windows-only to my knowledge. JNovelFormatter also has issues displaying some varieties of 傍点 and 傍線 while also leaving unprocessed 外字 in the output.

At this moment, the CSS file included, taken from JNovelFormatter, must be manually copied to each folder.
